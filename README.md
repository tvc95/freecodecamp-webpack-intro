# freecodecamp-webpack-intro
This is the practice code from the Free Code Camp tutorial course "Learn Webpack", from Colt Steele. You can check out his tutorial video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpGLUVbqoYQ). This was done solely for the purpose of learning how to config webpacks and there is almost no difference from the original code.
